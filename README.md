# C++ Web Application

## Description
This project is a web application that integrates C++ with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases the use of C++ for backend processing, with HTML and CSS for frontend design, and JavaScript for interactivity. The application allows users to interact with the backend through a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **Frontend**: Interactive design using HTML and CSS (Apple-like theme)
- **Backend**: C++ used for data processing and logic
- **Interactivity**: JavaScript enhances user experience and dynamic content
- **Customizable**: Easy to modify and extend the application

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: For backend logic and calculations
- **HTML/CSS**: For frontend design and layout
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and dynamic behavior

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AngshuCode/C-basic-to-advance
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd project C-basic-to-advance
    ```

3. Instructions to compile and run the C++ code (if applicable):
    - Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang).
    - Compile the C++ code:
      ```bash
      g++ -o main main.cpp
      ```

4. To run the web application:
    - Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
    - The frontend will communicate with the backend logic (if applicable) via AJAX or other methods.

## Usage
- Open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the application.
- Interact with the frontend interface, which uses JavaScript to process user inputs and communicate with the backend written in C++.
